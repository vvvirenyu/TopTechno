                <p> The mesmerizing, atmospheric techno of Belgian producer Amelie Lens was the natural progression from
                    her meteoric rise as one of Europe's most sought-after techno DJs, which started with her
                    minimalist-sounding 2016 debut, the Let It Go EP. </p>

                <p> Born and raised in Antwerp, Belgium, Lens grew up on a diet of alternative rock and dance music,
                    while clubbing at the age of 16 exposed her to the likes of <strong>Boyz Noise</strong> and
                    <strong>Ellen Allien</strong> before she really caught the bug after attending Belgium's Dour
                    Festival. Immersing herself in the history of electronic music, Lens continued to go clubbing, where
                    she met her partner, who happened to be a DJ and producer. Learning how to mix, she quickly realized
                    that music was her natural path and left her career in fashion to focus on it full-time. From
                    playing small clubs, Lens quickly developed her own style and became a sought-after DJ, playing huge
                    festivals and club nights across Europe. Producing was a natural progression and Lens delivered her
                    first EP for Pan-Pot's <strong>Second State Audio</strong> label in 2016. The following year saw her
                    deliver two more EPs for the label, building on her low-key, atmospheric techno sound, which now
                    featured her own hushed vocals. By 2018, Lens' DJ career had exploded and saw her playing dates
                    across the world, yet she still found time to set up her own label, <strong>Lenske</strong>, which
                    pushed new underground techno from the likes of Farrago and Milo Spykers, and featured her own
                    release, the Basiel EP. A split single with Regal on Involve also followed that year and with each
                    artist remixing the other for the release. ~ Rich Wilson, Rovi </p>
